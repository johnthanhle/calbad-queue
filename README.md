# Cal Badminton Queueing System
This is a queue system web application to be used at open gym at UC Berkeley. It is made using ERN stack (Express, React, Node). Currently only supports basic features such as adding/removing yourself with or without a partner to the queue. Other features include notifications that can only be sent by admins. As of now, notifications are currently only supported on Desktop versions of all browsers. Admins also have the power to remove users from the queue. The queuing system also utilizes the WebSocket API to allow for real-time collaborative editing!
